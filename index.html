Hi! I am a PhD student in Transportation Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My doctoral research focuses on multimodal terminal simulation and optimization, dynamic traffic network assignment, 
and the operational optimization of freight transportation systems. 
My research philosophy emphasizes sustainability and system-level efficiency in large-scale transportation networks.
</p>

<p>
My research interests span four interrelated areas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Multimodal Transportation Systems:</strong>
    Leveraging multi-source data fusion, including spatiotemporal datasets, to model and optimize mobility and freight transportation systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Advanced Simulation and Optimization for Freight Transportation Systems:</strong>
    Focusing on railway and intermodal operations by developing high-fidelity simulation and optimization frameworks, supported by advanced software development and digital twin integration.
  </li>

  <li>
  <strong>Transportation System Energy and Emissions Modeling:</strong>
  Developing quantitative frameworks to assess energy consumption, emissions, grid impacts, and costs across freight transportation systems under emerging low-carbon technologies.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Physics-Informed and AI-Driven Modeling:</strong>
    Exploring physics-informed learning and multimodal models to enhance system understanding, reasoning, and decision-making in complex transportation environments.
  </li>
</ul>
