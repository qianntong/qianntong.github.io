Hi! I am a PhD student in Transportation Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My doctoral research focuses on multimodal terminal simulation and optimization, dynamic traffic network assignment, 
and the operational optimization of freight transportation systems. 
My research philosophy emphasizes sustainability and system-level efficiency in large-scale transportation networks.
</p>

<p>
My research interests span four interrelated areas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Multimodal Transportation Systems:</strong>
    Leveraging multi-source data fusion, including spatiotemporal datasets, to characterize, model, and optimize mobility and freight transportation systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Advanced Simulation and Optimization for Freight Transportation Systems:</strong>
    Focusing on railway and intermodal operations through the development of high-fidelity simulation and optimization frameworks, 
    supported by robust software engineering practices and emerging digital twin.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Energy and Emissions Modeling:</strong>
    Developing quantitative models to evaluate energy consumption and mitigate environmental impacts across freight transportation systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Physics-Informed and AI-Driven Modeling:</strong>
    Exploring physics-informed learning, multimodal models, and agentic AI to enhance system understanding, reasoning, 
    and decision-making in complex transportation environments.
  </li>
</ul>
