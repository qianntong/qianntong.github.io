<p>
I am a PhD student in Civil Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
My research focuses on intermodal terminal operations, discrete-event simulation,
and optimization of freight transportation systems.

I am particularly interested in modeling container flows, yard congestion,
and performance functions that support terminal design and planning.
