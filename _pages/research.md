  <strong>INFORMES: INtermodal Freight Optimization for a Resilient Mobility Energy System</strong>
</span>

<p style="font-size:0.95em; color:#555;">
<strong>Funding Sources:</strong> U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E); project led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
INFORMES develops a national-level intermodal freight modeling framework to support strategic decision-making for the deployment and operational planning of freight decarbonization technologies. The project aims to guide efficient, resilient operations of the intermodal freight system under emerging energy and mobility paradigms.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
The research integrates two tightly coupled components within a Python-based, easily executable, and publicly distributable software platform. The <em>Infrastructure Model (IM)</em> represents the spatial and temporal deployment of low-carbon energy systems, transshipment terminals, and emerging vehicle operations, enabling optimization of resource allocation across the network. The <em>Logistics Model (LM)</em> simulates intermodal demand over a stochastic transportation system and produces robust, system-level optimization of intermodal logistics operations.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
Together, the IM and LM provide a holistic modeling environment for evaluating operational strategies, technology roll-out pathways, and resilience of national-scale intermodal freight systems.

  <strong>Developing a Multi-Modal Maritime–Rail–Road Transportation Model for Texas Inland and Intercoastal Waterways</strong>
</span>

<p style="font-size:0.95em; color:#555;">
<strong>Funding Sources:</strong> Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT); project led by the SPARTA Lab under the direction of Dr. Stephen Boyles
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
This project establishes a statewide multimodal freight modeling framework that integrates maritime, rail, and roadway systems to evaluate commodity flows, infrastructure capacity, and system-level performance across Texas inland and intercoastal waterways.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
The research synthesizes diverse Texas freight datasets to characterize statewide commodity movements, network topology, and capacity constraints. A network-based discrete-event simulation framework is developed to explicitly capture multimodal operations, congestion-induced delays, energy consumption, and system-level performance metrics.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1.6;">
Through systematic analysis of operational interactions under varying demand and capacity scenarios, the project identifies critical network bottlenecks and operational vulnerabilities. The resulting insights support freight planning, infrastructure investment prioritization, and resilience assessment for complex multimodal transportation systems.
