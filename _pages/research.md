## Projects

### INFORMES  
**INtermodal Freight Optimization for a Resilient Mobility Energy System**

**Funding Sources:**  
U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E);  
Project led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)

INFORMES aims to develop a national-level intermodal freight modeling framework to support decision-making in the deployment and operational planning of freight decarbonization technologies. The project focuses on guiding efficient and resilient operations of the intermodal freight system under emerging energy and mobility paradigms.

The research develops and integrates two core components:

- **Infrastructure Model (IM):** Models the deployment of low-carbon energy systems, transshipment terminals, and emerging vehicle operations, and determines the optimal spatial and temporal allocation of infrastructure and resources.
- **Logistics Model (LM):** Generates a robust, system-level optimization of intermodal logistics operations by simulating intermodal demand over a stochastic transportation network.

These components are integrated into a Python-based, modular, and publicly distributable software framework designed to be easily executable and extensible for national-scale freight system analysis.
